## Disclaimer & Responsible Use
### ⚠️ Regional Guest Account Warning: 
- The guest accounts in `guests_manager/` are from the IND server. If you are from a different region, replace these existing ones with your regional guests to properly receive likes.

Automates creating and capturing **Free Fire guest accounts** via **Frida**, formats and manages them, obtains **JWTs**, and sends encrypted like requests to a target UID with **concurrency controls** and **one-like-per-guest-per-target guarantees**.

---

## ⚡ Features
- Capture guest **uid/password/token** from the Android app via **Frida hooks** and persist on-device with de-duplication.
- **Auto-loop** guest creation by restarting after successful registration to mass-generate accounts.
- Convert captured guests into structured **JSONs**, skipping duplicates and invalid entries.
- Authenticate guests to obtain a **JWT** using **AES-CBC–wrapped protobuf requests**.
- Build protobuf **LikeProfile payloads**, **AES-CBC encrypt** them, and send **concurrent likes** with usage tracking.

---

## Repository structure
- **dev/frida_injections**: Frida scripts for capture and auto-restart flows.
- **ff_proto**: Protobufs used by authentication and like payload builders.
- **guests_manager**: Tools and data for formatting and storing captured guests.
- **Python clients**: JWT acquisition, like payload encryption, and like sender.
- **index.js**: Il2Cpp/Frida helpers used by injection scripts.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Android device** with **Frida server** or **Frida Gadget**, reachable via USB or TCP.
- **Python 3.10+** with `httpx`, `pycryptodome`, `protobuf` installed.
- **Protobuf modules compiled** and present under `ff_proto` (`FreeFire_pb2.py`, `like_pb2.py`).

### Install:
    pip install httpx pycryptodome protobuf
    or 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
### Usage (For sending likes)
    python3 send_like.py
---

## 👤 Guest account creation workflow
- Attach `capture_and_save_guest.js` while launching the game to hook SharedPreferences and relevant classes, collecting uid/password/token.
- The script reads an existing `guest_accounts.json` in the app’s external media directory, appends unique entries, and writes atomically.
- Load `restart_after_register.js` to detect registration completion and trigger a timed restart for continuous guest generation.
- Load `index.js` or no hooking will work.

### Launch options:
- **Interactive**: `python3 dev/frida_injections/frida_manager.py` (choose USB/TCP and scripts).
- Then use image clicker to click on respective positions one after another and the script will work on its own save guest data in the apps permissible dir inside `Android/data/com.dts.freefiremax/`
- **Manual**: `frida -U -n Gadget -l dev/frida_injections/capture_and_save_guest.js -l dev/frida_injections/restart_after_register.js -l dev/frida_injections/index.js`.

### Notes:
- `frida_manager.py` validates connectivity, restarts sessions, and manages default script lists; adjust `PROCESS_NAME`/`DEFAULT_JS_SCRIPTS` as needed.

## Convert and deduplicate guests
- Run: `python3 guests_manager/save_guest.py` to merge new captures into repo JSONs.
- Outputs: `formatted_guests.json` map and `guests_converted.json` flat array used by automation.
- Behavior: skips duplicates, ignores `unknown_*` placeholders, preserves numbering, and reports counts.

---


## Builds encrypted Like payload
- **Function**: `create_like_payload(uid_to_like, region) -> bytes (application/octet-stream)`
- **Internals**: constructs `like_pb2.like`, serializes, applies PKCS7 padding, AES-CBC encrypts the serialized bytes with `MAIN_KEY` / `MAIN_IV`, and returns the encrypted payload ready for POST.

---

## ⚡Send likes (concurrent, safe)
- Run: `python3 send_like.py`, then provide target UID, desired like count, and max concurrency.
- **Behavior**:  
  - Loads guests from `guests_converted.json`  
  - Obtains JWT and region per guest (via the JWT flow) if not cached  
  - Builds an encrypted Like payload using `create_like_payload`  
  - Posts the encrypted payload to the LikeProfile endpoint with required headers and auth  
  - Retries transient errors and respects per-request backoff / RPS limits
- **Guarantee**: one-like-per-guest-per-target enforced via `usage_history/guest_usage_by_target.json`.
- Concurrency controls and RPS limiting are applied to reduce throttling and detect rate limits early.

---

## 🪛Configuration tips
- If using Gadget, keep `PROCESS_NAME="Gadget"`; otherwise set the app process name in `frida_manager.py`.
- Tune concurrency and RPS to avoid throttling and fit within daily per-target limits.
- Prefer the `server_url` returned by the JWT flow when endpoints are region-scoped.

---

## Data files
- `guests_manager/formatted_guests.json`: human-readable map of captured guests.
- `guests_manager/guests_converted.json`: automation-ready array used by the sender.
- `usage_history/guest_usage_by_target.json`: tracks which guest has liked which target to enforce one-like-per-guest-per-target.
